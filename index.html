<p> This repository <strong>("Code - OSS")</strong> is where we (Microsoft) develop the Visual Studio Code product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also
    publish our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap">roadmap</a>,<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans">monthly iteration plans</a>, and our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame">endgame plans</a>.

<h3> Visual Studio Code </h2>
<hr>
<img src="./–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è1.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<p> Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional Microsoft product license.

    Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.
    
    Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Visual Studio Code's website. To get the latest releases every day, install the Insiders build. </p>

<h3>Development Container</h3>
<hr>
<p> This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container. </p>
<ul>
    <li>For Dev Containers, use the <strong><em>Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...</em></strong> command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows. </li>
    <li>For Codespaces, install the GitHub Codespaces extension in VS Code, and use the <strong><em>Codespaces: Create New Codespace</em></strong> command. </li>
</ul>
<p>Docker / the Codespace should have at least <strong>4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)</strong> to run full build. See the development container README for more information.</p>
